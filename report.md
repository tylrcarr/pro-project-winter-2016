# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Winter 2016

*Replace this sample with your own report*

We did a great job in creating this web server. There was a lot of work on the backend that I completed successfully and there was a lot that Troy did. 

## Lessons Learned

There was a lot of stuff that we didn't get to, such as a search bar and the admin page completion. I learned a lot about Mongo and Node.

## Next Steps

I honestly don't even know what I want to do. I might redo this in Go, maybe I'll improve the CSS to this, maybe I will create a new project.
