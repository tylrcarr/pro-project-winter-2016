# SkilStak Pro Project Documentation - Winter 2016

Congratulations! You made it through the first official SkilStak
Pro course. It has been amazing watching your projects and the
format of the course take shape. One of the things that we started
(but did not finish up) was this idea of a Project Documentation
repo. The concept was a bit nebulous to some, so going forward we
will always have you fork the *SkilStak Pro Project Documentation*
repo containing the schedule, deadlines, and expectations for that
specific semester.

Next (Summer 2016) semester will have a full repo from the start.
Please make sure [you review
it](https://github.com/skiltak/pro-project-summer-2016).

This Winter semester, however, the documentation requirement will
be less. All that is required is that you fork this repo and fill
out the [**Final Report**](report.md) by the 5:30 PM Saturday, April
30. Please take this assignment seriously since it will be presented
to your parents as well as weigh in the decision to offering
continuing Pro invites for Summer.

Thanks for the great work you have done this semester, for yourselves
and for SkilStak.

Sincerely,
Mr. Rob
